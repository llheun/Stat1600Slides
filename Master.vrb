\frametitle{WMU Undergraduatesâ€™ Average GPA}

Recall that the sample of $n = 25$ students yielded a sample mean of $\bar{X} = 3.05$ with a standard error of $SE = 0.08$.  The margin of error is then $ME = 1.96 \times 0.08 = 0.157$. Hence a 95\% CI for the true average  GPA, $\mu$, is:

$$(3.05 - 0.157, 3.05 + 0.157) = (2.893, 3.207)$$.

Interpretation: based on the sample, we are 95\% confident that the  true mean GPA is in between 2.9 and 3.2, approximately.
